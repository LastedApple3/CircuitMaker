Each interface component has a Board.InterfaceLocation
Each graphical component has a PointF





Designing the interaction form


Board has GraphicalComponents & InterfaceComponents

Editor gets Component with Board

Dictionary<string(InterfaceComponent.ComponentName), InterfaceLocation> interfaceLocationSaves
Dictionary<GraphicalComponent, PointF> graphicsLocationSaves

GUI live updates it

ResetChanges just loads these back up.
