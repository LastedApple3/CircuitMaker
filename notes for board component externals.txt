need to store shape (use Rectangle)
need to store location of every boardinterfacecomponent
need to prevent shrinking it beyond capacity

will also need functionality of rendering <- need to do this first.

Each interface component has a Board.InterfaceLocation
Each graphical component has a PointF





Designing the interaction form


Board has GraphicalComponents & InterfaceComponents

Editor gets Component with Board

Save each thing that will be edited
Dictionary<string(InterfaceComponent.ComponentName), InterfaceLocation> interfaceLocationSaves
Dictionary<GraphicalComponent, PointF> graphicsLocationSaves

GUI live updates it

ResetChanges just loads these back up.


When you add a input/output automatically make it taller to work. make it wider by a decreased factor?
2x2
4x4
6x4
8x6
add 2 to height, if height is double width add 2 to width

interface loc generator:
	figure out quarter (divided diagonally):
		x > 0 && 
		compare x+y (and x-y?)
