BIDIR should describe its default state as testing:
	What is the simulated external state of this component?
INPUT should mention default:
	What is the default state of this component?
Shrink the buffers?
	shape: (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, 0) -> (-0.5, -0.5), (-0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0)
	default input: (-2, 0) -> (-1, 0)
	default output: (2, 0) -> (1, 0)
	bounds
	inversion circle?
BIDIR pins on BOARDs are counted twice in the pin rendering code
add a tag base class?
	all the tags that exist:
		INPUT, OUTPUT, BIDIR, TOGGLE, FIXED, PROBE
		PULLUP, PULLDOWN when they exist.
	need to allow variation of length, and rotation
	text rendering builtin (used for INPUT, OUTPUT, BIDIR names and PROBE indicator)
	add identifier symbols for TOGGLE and FIXED, and later PULLUP and PULLDOWN
