planning for third iteration of interaction code, previous two deleted

start drawing wire only if clicking on a pin which is displayed.
select wires, double clicking a selected wire also starts drawing wire.
drawing wire means that clicking on a comp doesn't select, but simply does nothing.

redo interaction for a third time? complete redesign? i think so.

all the things that need to be done:
	move component
	select component
	edit component
	copy component <- ContextMenu
	delete component <- ContextMenu
	create component <- ContextMenu
	create wire
	delete wire <- ContextMenu
	select wire

attach settings to right click? use right click menu (ContextMenu)?

on left click:
	if dragging:
		place
	else:
		if on comp:
			if comp is selected comp:
				drag comp
			else:
				select comp
		else if on wire:
			if wire is selected wire:
				start wire
			else:
				select wire
		else:
			deselect

on double left click:
	if dragging:
		reset comp
	if on comp:
		if comp is selected comp:
			open comp settings

on right click:
	if on comp:
		select comp
		open comp ContextMenu
	else:
		open generic ContextMenu

on key press:
	if delete:
		delete selected object

comp ContextMenu:
	Open Settings (if has settings)
	Move Component
	Copy Component
	Delete Component

generic ContextMenu:
	Start Simulation
	Create Component (opens dialog)




thoughts further:
	Selection has the ability to take an Action<ComponentOrWire> that will be run on all it's members.
	ComponentOrWire has a static func that takes an Action<IComponent> and an Action<Wire> and returns the relevant Action<ComponentOrWire>
