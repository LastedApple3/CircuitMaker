start drawing wire only if clicking on a pin which is displayed.
select wires, double clicking a selected wire also starts drawing wire.
drawing wire means that clicking on a comp doesn't select, but simply does nothing.

redo interaction for a third time? complete redesign? i think so.

all the things that need to be done:
	move component
	select component
	edit component
	copy component
	delete component
	create component
	create wire
	delete wire
	select wire?

attach settings to right click? use right click menu (ContextMenu)?
