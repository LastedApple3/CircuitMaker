right click and drag is pan always

if editing:
	if drawing wire:
		left click puts one wire down and starts the next
		left double click ends drawing wire
	else if on not selected component:
		left click is select
	else if on selected component:
		left click and drag is move component
		left double click opens component settings
	else:
		left click deselects
		left click starts drawing wire
if simulating:
	if on interactible component:
		component.Interact

states:
	moving comp
	drawing wire
	panning
	none

notes:
	for drawing wire, a double click will raise MouseClick event (attach to end wire, start next) and MouseDoubleClick event (attach to discard current wire, change state)

events:
	on MouseClick, MouseDoubleClick, MouseDown, MouseUp, MouseMove, MouseScroll

	MouseDown, MouseClick, MouseUp
	MouseDown, MouseDoubleClick, MouseUp

	click and up occur together


need to rework DragType to remove panning, just use bool for panning as it can be done completely separately from any other type of dragging.

for left click while editing, logic is as follows

on MouseClick:
	if moving component:
		put down component
	else:
		if on selected component:
			pick up component
		else if on component:
			select component
		else:
			deselect component

on MouseDoubleClick:
	if moving component:
		reset component
	if on selected component and selected component has settings:
		open settings
	else:
		raise MouseClick event? just call OnMouseClick?
