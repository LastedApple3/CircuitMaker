cascading interaction is BOARD components allowing interaction with contained IInteractibleComponents

IInteractibleComponent inherits from IGraphicalComponent
IInteractibleComponent.Interact takes a PointF representing the relative location (same coordinate system as GraphicalElementBounds)

existing IInteractibleComponents are updated to match this
BOARD component is updated to be IInteractibleComponent instead of IGraphicalComponent
