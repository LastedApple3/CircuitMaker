pins are correctly placed, but not rotated
	confirmed Pos.Rotate works right
	issue was that Pos.Rotate required Rotation to be one of the 4 options, while scrolling could move it beyond the bounds - an angle >270 or <0.

rendering (only transformed by GetRenderMatrix) rotated around the origin
	this was fixed by swapping the Rotate and Translate
	but they were already the right way round, and now they are the wrong way round
	worked: translate, then rotate
	should work: rotate then translate
	why
	oh well
